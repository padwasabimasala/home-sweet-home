# Recursively deletes folders named .svn in a given dir

# Author: Matthew Thorley
# Ideas: 
#   Add are you sure delete in dir 'dirname'?
#   Add ask for each or no ask option?
#   Add recursive/nonrecursive option
#
# Usage: unsubversion [dir]


# If no dir is given use . as default
if [ "$1" = "" ];then
    DIR="."
else
    DIR=$1
fi

# Check that the dir exists and is a dir
if [ ! -d "$DIR" ];then
    echo "File $DIR does not exist or is not a directory."
    exit 1
fi

# Recursively delete all dirs named '.svn' in $DIR
for i in $(find $DIR -type d -name .svn); do rm -Rf $i; done
